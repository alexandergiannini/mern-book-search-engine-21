# Book Search Engine using MERN

# Hi there! My name is Alex Giannini and this is my Book Search Engine, built with a MERN Stack! I refactored this application so that it can use an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries/mutations in order to fetch/modify data, along with updating the authentication middleware. I also created an Apollo Provider so requests can be communicate properly to the Apollo Server. Using MERN, we utilized Express, MongoDB, Node, and React to make this application possible, which is deployed to Heroku. Using this application you can sign up/login, then search for any books you desire and save them. You can see all of the saved books for your specific user and you can remove those books as well. Hope you enjoy!
